# JOBTRACKER APP

## About

The Jobtracker App let's you add and update job entries (company_name, position_title, location, apply_date, status, description) and display them based on status ("open", "interview", "rejected", "offer") to keep track of all your applied jobs.
Job entries are saved in a csv file named "job_data.csv".
